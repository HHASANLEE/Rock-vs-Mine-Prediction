Rock vs Mines Prediction

Overview:

This project is a Machine Learning model designed to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on input data. The model leverages numerical and statistical features to achieve accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool for applications in geology and underwater exploration.

Features:

Binary Classification: Distinguishes between rocks and mines.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Scalable: Designed for ease of deployment and scaling.

Dataset:

Source: [Provide link or source of the dataset, e.g., UCI Sonar Dataset]

Description: The dataset consists of numerical features extracted from sonar signals. Each sample is labeled as either a rock or a mine.

Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.
